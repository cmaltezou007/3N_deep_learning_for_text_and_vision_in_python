# 3N_deep_learning_for_text_and_vision_in_python

This repository contains two assignment submissions for my 3N course in Python:

- **Assignment 1 (text)**: Pre-process the SST-2 data (from HuggingFace); use a pre-trained transformer architecture such as DistilBERT for classification, including fine-tuning; report accuracy and F1.
- **Assignment 2 (vision)**: Build a custom CNN from scratch, using convolutional layers, pooling, and dropout; train the CNN on Fashion-MNIST; report accuracy and F1; use Grad-CAM to shed some light on how the model makes predictions.

Google Colab was used to complete both assigments.
